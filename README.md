## Basic Details
### Team Name: Anila Benny


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Anila Benny - Jyothi Engineering CollegeThe.

### Project Description
 *Vibe Checker 3000* is a fun Tkinter app that gives users a random, quirky ‚Äúvibe‚Äù message based on their name. It adds humor and personality to a simple interactive experience

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[What ridiculous problem are you solving?]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Sometimes people wake up unsure of their *exact* vibe for the day ‚Äî a truly dire and completely overlooked crisis. The *Vibe Checker 3000* heroically solves this by assigning you an absurdly accurate mood reading.


## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:

 Languages used:Python
 Frameworks used: None (pure Tkinter app)
 Libraries used: Tkinter (GUI), random (vibe selection)
 Tools used: Python IDLE / VS Code (for coding & testing)



### Implementation
Implementation ‚Äì For Software:

The *Vibe Checker 3000* is implemented in Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface.

 A list of predefined funny ‚Äúvibe‚Äù messages is stored in the program.
 The `check_vibe()` function retrieves the user‚Äôs name from the input field, validates it, and uses the `random.choice()` function to select a vibe.
 The result is dynamically displayed on the interface via a Tkinter `Label`.
 Widgets such as `Entry`, `Button`, and `Label` are used to handle input, actions, and output display.
 The program runs in a loop using `app.mainloop()` to keep the interface active until closed by the user.

# Installation
Installation ‚Äì For Software

1. Install Python

    Download and install Python (version 3.8 or later) from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
    Make sure to tick **"Add Python to PATH"** during installation.

2. Set up the Project

    Create a new folder and save the Python file (e.g., `vibe_checker.py`) inside it.

3. Install Required Libraries

    Tkinter usually comes pre-installed with Python.
    If not, install it using:

     ```bash
     pip install tk
     ```

4. Run the Application

    Open a terminal or command prompt in your project folder.
    Run:

     ```bash
     python vibe_checker.py
     ```
    The Vibe Checker 3000 window will pop up, ready to give you your daily vibe.



# Run


```bash
python vibe_checker.py
```

This command will launch the **Vibe Checker 3000** Tkinter app so you can start checking your daily vibes.
